    Caption1: "How much fat have you lost so far?",
    Description: "So you've been on a fat loss journey for a while now, and been making progress and also noting down your stats and measurements (hopefully, because otherwise this tool won't work!) When you lose weight, a part of it is lost from fat and some of it from muscle. That proportion varies from person to person, and depends on many factors, like protein intake and how much caloric deficit you're running. Not going into all that, this tool will measure how much body fat you had when you started, and how much you have now. That way, you can get an idea of how much of your hard-earned muscle is being retained, and how much is actually being lost from fat.",
